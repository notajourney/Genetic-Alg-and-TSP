This little profect is about solving TSP pronlem with 150 points at Tokyo city, using a modified GA (Genetic Algorythm)
Branch master :: we can find 
-GA.py: general genetic algorythm implementation
-calcTSP.py:: contains a function to compute a tour length and a basic main function that generates random tours and computes their value ( for future reference)
-Tokyo.dat :: A text file file representing the Graph


Branch my_changes: is the algoryhm as it is modifed for the problem
-GA_TSP.py :: the general algorythm modified for tsp (no genotip at all)
-GA_TSP_Operators :: mutation and crossover operators modified for permutations data
